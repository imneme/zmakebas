This readme is a mess due to the history of this program and where I originally forked it from :)

Any queries specifically relating to the Amiga builds should be raised on the issue tracker.


README_ADDENDUM states:

Windows Installation:

A 32 bit binary exe for the Windows platform is included, compiled using MinGW.

All questions or issues relating to this binary should be sent to Alistair Neil and not the original author.

Original README.md follows....



This is Cat's Eye Technologies' fork of zmakebas, a tokenizer for
Spectrum BASIC files.  It takes a BASIC program source, as a text
file, as input, and produces a .TAP file containing the tokenized
program, as output.

This was forked from OS2World's APP-EMULATOR-zmakebas, because it
was convenient to do so.  The changes to port it to OS/2 were
trivial and have been reverted.  It compiles under Ubuntu 12.04
and I would be extremely surprised if it didn't also compile under
FreeBSD, Cygwin, etc.

The original readme documents are included below, in this order:

*   The readme for the OS/2 port
*   OS2World's readme

zmakebas 1.2 - convert text files into Spectrum Basic programs.
Public domain by Russell Marks.


Description
-----------

zmakebas converts a Spectrum Basic program written as a text file into
an actual speccy Basic file (as a .TAP file, or optionally a raw
headerless file).

Using zmakebas rather than (say) writing the Basic in an emulator
means you can write using a nicer editor, and can use tools which work
on text files, etc. Also, with the `-l` option you can write without
line numbers, using labels in their place where necessary.

The program was originally intended to be used simply to make little
loader programs, so they wouldn't have to be sourceless binaries.
However, I went to a fair amount of effort to make sure it'd work for
bigger, more serious programs too, so you can also use it for that
kind of thing.


Installation
------------

While I think zmakebas should be fairly portable, I've only ever
compiled it on Linux and MS-DOS. Things should be ok for Linux as-is -
just do `make` then (as root) `make install`.


Miscellaneous
-------------

See the man page for details of how to use zmakebas.

There's a short demo file showing the use of escape sequences for UDGs
and block graphics characters etc. here, named `demo.bas`. You can use
`zmakebas demo.bas` to generate an `out.tap` file from it. A version
using labels is in `demolbl.bas`, which can be converted with
`zmakebas -l demolbl.bas`.

This is a quick port of zmakebas for OS/2.

I needed only to add -Zexe to the build flags into the original makefile.

ZMakeBas is actually a program to convert BASIC programs (written for the great Sinclair ZX Spectrum
or its US release, the TS2068) into .TAP files which can be directly loaded into an emulator, or
transferred to a real Speccy.

This port was built with GCC 3.3.5 and the build environment made by Paul Smedley.

For details on how to use zmakebas.exe, read the README file and the included manpage (sorry for
not processing it - I still didn't configure the proper tools).

If you like these programs, please consider making a donation to Paul Smedley, which is doing
a tremendous amount of work to let us have more and more programs updated and new, OS/2 native.

Have fun!
